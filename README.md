# sharefile_py3
A python 3 program to work with Citrix's Sharefile API.

This is a (mostly) python 3 compatible version of Citrix's published python example with extensions based on their web API.

The program as a whole is designed to upload files in a local directory to folders already created on sharefile, and then create shared URLs which are used in automatic e-mail generation.
E.g. c:\local_reports\OrgAReport20150407.pdf is uploaded resulting in  /Orgs/Org A. Corp/OrgACorpReport20150407.pdf.
We then get the file id by searching the remote sharefile directory and create a DL URL which is output to a file.

The one relatively new item is the create_share_link function which creates the URLs. Note they currently have a hard-coded expiration date.

The original (python 2) source can be found here:
